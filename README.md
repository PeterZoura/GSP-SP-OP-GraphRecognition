GraphProject4990_2023F
graph generator can be used to generate file for graph of any size.


Compile C-Style dfs:
g++ dfs.cpp -o dfs -O3

run:
./dfs 32V.txt output.txt

any graph can be substituted for 32V.txt, but it must be in the same folder as the compiled program

Compile C++ style dfs:
g++ df2.cpp -o dfs2 -O3 -std=c++20

run:
./dfs2 32V.txt
no output file is coded to be produced yet.

C style is slightly more consistent in having fast speeds, but both are almost equally fast.

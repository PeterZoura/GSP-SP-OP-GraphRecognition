//usage: ./dfs <input_graph>

/*
terminology guide
input file is a list of pairs of integers
the first pair represents n and m, the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph
each next pair represents an edge, labelled by two vertex numbers

- adj is an array containing the adjacency lists of each vertex, stored one after another in the array
- adjAddress is an array containing the index to go to in "adj" in order to get the start of the adjacency list for vertex number i
for example:
   adj[i] returns the first vertex in the adjacency list for vertex j
   adj[i+1] returns the next vertex in the adjacency list for vertex j
   adjAddress[j] returns the index i to use in adj[i] to get the adjacency list for vertex j

   so that adj[adjAddress[3]] gets me the first vertex in the adjacency list for vertex 3

   for (int x = adjAddress[i]; x < adjAddress[i+1]; x++){
      in each iteration of loop, x will be the index of each vertex in the adjacency list for vertex i
      so that each iteration
      adj[x]
      will be a different vertex in the adjacency list for vertex i
      until x reaches the adjacency list index for vertex i+1, then the loop stops.
   }

- stack is an array used as a stack
- stack_pointer is the index that represents the top of the stack
   if stack_pointer is set to 0 then that means there is one vertex in the stack
   stack[0] would return that vertex number. you can use that vertex number with adjAddress[]
   to get the adacency list index for the vertex, you could use that index with adj[] to get the adjacency list of the vertex
   for example
   there is one vertex in the stack at the beginning
   stack_pointer = 0
   v = stack[stack_pointer] //returns the vertex number for the vertex on top of the stack
   i = adjAddress[v] //returns the index for adj[] for that vertex on top of the stack
   v2 = adj[i] //returns the first vertex adjacent to the vertex we started with.

   or all in one line

   v2 = adj[adjAddress[stack[stack_pointer]]]

- stackAddress is an address array corresponding to the vertices in the stack
   since adjAddress[stack[stack_pointer]] is a pain to write and to look at, we simply maintain another stack to hold the
   adjacency list index numbers corresponding to the vertex numbers in stack[]
   
   so 
   v2 = adj[adjAddress[stack[stack_pointer]]]
   is the same as
   v2 = adj[stackAddress[stack_pointer]]
